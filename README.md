## Requirement
This was built using php.activerecord, Twig and Kunststube-Router.  
The preferred way to install them is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc):  
  
Install Composer to current dir:  
`curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php`  
  
Install dependencies:  
`php composer.phar install`  
  
Thats all.
